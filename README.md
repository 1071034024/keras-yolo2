Introduction

	This is a proof of concept implementation of YOLO using Keras.

Instruction

	Download VOC data and pre-trained weights
		Download VOC data
		Download pre-trained weights
		Specify directory for annotation
		Specify directory for images
		Specify directory for trained weights
	Follow the steps in the notebook for a walkthrough the whole process
		Initialization of parameters
		Construct the network
		Load the pretrained weights
		Proprocess the data
		Train the network (the weights of the last layers are randomized before training)
		Perform detection on an image
